Contest / Raffle Feature

You've been asked to implement a new "contests" feature for a successful online retailer. In each of these online contests, users should be able to enter tickets for specific prizes until the contest ends, at which point the prizes are awarded and shipped to the winners.

The existing e-commerce platform already has models and business logic for:
Users
Products
Checkout/shipping

Contest requirements:
Multiple contests may be active at once
Contests may have multiple prizes
Users should be awarded tickets for past purchase history and other site activity
Users should be able to allocate tickets toward specific prizes in the contest
Tickets are specific to each contest
Winners should be chosen randomly from all tickets entered for each prize in a contest
Each contest may have separate rules indicating how many tickets should be awarded to each user

How might you design this feature?
